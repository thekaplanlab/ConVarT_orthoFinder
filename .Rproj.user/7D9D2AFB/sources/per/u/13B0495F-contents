`orthoFinder` function can be used to find orthologous variants between species. `msa` file generated by `ConVarT_Pipeline` is used as an input. Other required files are:

-   Variant data as `data.table` or `data.frame`, with at least following columns:

    -   `Refseq_ID`: NCBI reference sequence id of proteins.

    -   `aapos`: Amino acid position of variants.

    -   `from`: Reference amino acid.

    -   `to`: Converting amino acid.

-   `msa` table need to be converted to following format:

```{r, include=FALSE}

```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
